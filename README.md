## 📂 Dataset Overview

The Project consists of detailed automotive information, including:
- **Specifications**: fuel type, number of cylinders, aspiration, drive wheels, etc.
- **Performance**: horsepower, city/highway MPG, compression ratio.
- **Design**: body style, length, width, curb weight, number of doors.
- **Safety**: symboling (safety rating).
- **Market**: make (brand), price.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 🔹 Fuel Efficiency
- **Drive wheel types** vary significantly in highway fuel efficiency.
- A small number of cars stand out with **exceptional city MPG**, surpassing the 90th percentile.

### 🔹 Engine & Power
- Cars with **more than six cylinders** are notably higher in price, especially when grouped by fuel type.
- **Diesel vs. Gas**: diesel cars show distinct horsepower performance compared to gas-powered vehicles.

### 🔹 Pricing Patterns
- Clear variation in **average car prices across makes**, indicating different market segments.
- Majority of cars fall within **one standard deviation** of the average price, while a notable group exceeds the **75th percentile**, representing the luxury category.

### 🔹 Design & Structure
- The **length-to-width ratio** varies by body style, influencing design preferences and vehicle aerodynamics.
- Among longer cars, **total curb weight** is significantly higher in certain body styles.

### 🔹 Safety & Niche Segments
- Safest cars (lowest symboling) are identified along with their make and price range.
- Rare configurations such as **4WD cars with 2 doors** and **gas-turbo combinations** are highlighted, useful for niche market targeting.
